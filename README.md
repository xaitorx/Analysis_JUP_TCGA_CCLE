# Analysis_JUP_TCGA_CCLE
 JUP is a candidate IRE1 RIDD substrate in Triple Negative Breast Cancer. 
 Explore levels of JUP mRNA across breast cancer subtypes, cell lines. 
 Explore correlation with IRE1 activity. 

# Levels of IRE1 activity vs levels of JUP mRNA transcript

Across 1100 patient tumor samples from TCGA-BRCA project
Tumor subtype indicated by color code.
